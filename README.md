Hey, I'm Xinmei. I'm currently a sophomore studying Data Science at UC Berkeley. I've taken data science, programming, calculus and linear algebra classes. My most recent obession is discrete math and probability.

Projects:

My first machine learning project: Classifying Movies (Data 8)
- I had a dataset full of movies from a variety of genres and age. I used exploratory data analysis and linear regression to identify how the most frequent words are connected to the movies' genre.

In comparison, my latest project: Exploring Cook County Housing (Data 100)
- Part 1)
- The dataset consists of over 500,000 records from Cook County, Illinois. I used feature engineering to created a visualization that showed if there exists an association between bedrooms and log sale price and if there is any correlation between Log Sale Price and the total area occupied by the property.

- Part 2)
- From part 1, my goal was to fit a linear model to a few features of the housing data to predict house prices. Then, I analyzed the error of the model to improve the model's performance. Using my model, I found the RMSE of the training and testing data to estimate the amount of houses that are estimated.
