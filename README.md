# Welcome to Xinmei's Website

Hey, I'm Xinmei. I'm currently a sophomore studying Data Science at UC Berkeley. I've taken data science, programming, calculus and linear algebra classes. My most recent obession is discrete math and probability.

##Projects:

My first machine learning project: Classifying Movies (Data 8)
- I had a dataset full of movies from a variety of genres and age. I used exploratory data analysis and linear regression to identify how the most frequent words are connected to the movies' genre.

In comparison, my latest project: Exploring Cook County Housing (Data 100)
- Part 1)  
- The dataset consists of over 500,000 records from Cook County, Illinois. I used feature engineering to created a visualization that showed if there exists an association between bedrooms and log sale price and if there is any correlation between Log Sale Price and the total area occupied by the property.

- Part 2)  
- From part 1, my goal was to fit a linear model to a few features of the housing data to predict house prices. Then, I analyzed the error of the model to improve the model's performance. Using my model, I found the RMSE of the training and testing data to estimate the amount of houses that are estimated.

One of my favorite projects (Building my own world):
- I completed this project with my partner and we built a Pac-Man style game with a start menu that took in seeds. We used pseudo-random variables to generate pseudo-random backgrounds.
- We added a features like saving and loading, a flashlight, real-time tracker, and a HUD that displays the current tile the cursor hovers over.

Orgs/Clubs
- I'm part of WiCDS (Women in Computing and Data Science). Last semester, I partnered up to complete a project to see if there is an association between heart rate and cognitive fatigue. We used open-source data from Kaggle and tried to find a correlation between measuring heart rate using different methods and tiredness.
- There were some issues we ran into. Mainly, it was because there was not a lot of data to work with. The study only spanned about 1-2 days with about 5 participants.

Hobbies
- In my free time, I really enjoy playing badminton. I played in high school and plan to continue recreationally in college.
- I also enjoy crocheting and making clothes like shirts and sweaters.
